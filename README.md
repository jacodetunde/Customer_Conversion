## Analysis
### Aggregate Conversion rate.
This is done by dividing the total number of clients subscribed to a term deposit by the total number of clients 
- the conversition rate is 11.27%
### Conversion Rates by Age
This is done by grouping the clients by age and sum over the conversion column to get the total number of conversions by each age.
Then the group by age is then divided by total number of clients in each age group.
To avoid unwanted noise in the old age group, multiple ages are grouped into six groups, based on their age:  between 18 and  30, between 30 and 40, between 40 and 50, between 50 and 60, between 60 and 70, and 70 older. The resulting data are below.
